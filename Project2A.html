<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Organization:</h4>
	<p>	This website is meant to be used to allow individuals who play the video game Diablo 3 to save and store the
	information of different characters they currently have. It is meant to support the gaming community as a forum
	for discussions, an informational database, and as a character modeling system.
	</p>
	<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Goals:</h4>
	The goal of the site is to provide an environment for the console based community of Diablo 3 to have a common
	location to save their character info, to share achievements, display current character progress, and to work
	together towards common goals in a way that encourages collaboration and communication.
	<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Website Objective:</h4>
	The objective of MyD3Characters.com is to provide console edition players a way to model, display, share, and
	collaborate together to improve the Diablo 3 community in a way currently unavailable to those not on the PC
	edition of the game.
	<br>	
<h4 style="text-align:center">Services Provided</h4>
	While the PC edition of the game has a site called the Armory, where characters can be loaded and viewed with
	the gear they currently have on, the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 do not have this
	function. MyD3Characters.com will allow users to select gear they have previously saved, edit and then save
	updated statistics on the gear itself, and to test different combinations of gear to see which gives them the
	most desirable results as far as number crunching towards damage, resistance, or regeneration goals.<br><br>

	In addition, the console version of the site will strive to do something that the PC site does not: It will
	attempt to include the various bonuses and “extra” abilities that some gear will give a user as part of the
	calculations run to determine the character’s damage per second (DPS), toughness, and regeneration statistics.
	Damage based abilities will also be calculated based on a real number, as well as a percentage value, where
	the percentage value will be how much damage the ability will do when compared to the base line ability with
	no modifiers, as well as a 1 : X comparison, where X is the amount of damage that will occur for every 1 point
	that would have occurred normally (such as 1: 300, 1:57, 1:146).

					ranging from ages 16 and above. The average age will likely be in their 20’s, because most of that age group grew up
					with Diablo I and II. The age restriction of the website however, will be 13 years or older without parental consent.</td>
